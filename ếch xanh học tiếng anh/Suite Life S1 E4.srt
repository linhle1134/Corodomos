1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,466
Hey, come on, man.

2
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:06,833
We have to go work
on our science project.

3
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:11,299
I am doing science.
Look, centrifugal force.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,499
Moseby, Nina
fryburger just threw

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,132
the most incredible
birthday party for a dog.

6
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:18,599
Ivana's upset.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,699
Of course she is.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,833
Look at that stupid
hat you put on her.

9
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:22,999
Cat person.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,299
So, now I want a bigger,
better party for Ivana

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,300
in the grand ballroom.

12
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:28,733
Here's the guest list.

13
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:31,566
I will take care
of it personally.

14
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:32,899
Thank you. Mm-hmm.

15
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,499
Maddie, take care
of it personally.

16
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,232
No one else will touch it?

17
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:41,032
Not with a 10-foot
pooper-scooper.

18
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:43,099
Oh, Mr. Moseby,
you receive a fax.

19
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,033
The Tipton hotel inspector

20
00:00:44,034 --> 00:00:45,999
is on the way for
surprise inspection.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,899
But how can it be a
surprise inspection

22
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,966
if they sent a fax?

23
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,132
Because the fax came 2 weeks ago

24
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,799
and I forgot to give it to you.

25
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,199
Surprise!

26
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,199
Fortunately for all of us,

27
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,099
my hotel is always
in tiptop Tipton shape,

28
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,300
and nothing has changed
since the last inspection.

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,567

hey, Muriel, when
you were cleaning in there,

45
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,733
did you see a $5.00 bill?

46
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:59,666
I thought you
were throwing that away.

47
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,499
It was on my dresser.

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,300
My bad.

49
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:07,232
Hide me!

50
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:08,866
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened?

51
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:09,867
Mr. Moseby's after me

52
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:11,933
just 'cause I
was playing yo-yo in the lobby,

53
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:15,499
and it might
have landed in his mug.

54
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,400
And then?

55
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:18,199
I ran after that.

56
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,699
He scares me.

57
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,232
Mr. Moseby's just doing his job.

58
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:23,499
He needs to keep
this hotel running smoothly,

59
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,399
and you tend to be unsmooth.

60
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,699
Yeah, unsmooth
like when mom doesn't shave

61
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,500
her legs for 2 weeks.

62
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,733
Aren't you two
supposed to be working

63
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:36,099
on your science experiment?

64
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,567
We've already started. Look!

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,199
Aah! No, no, no, no!

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,966
What... what
are you doing with those rats?

67
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:46,567
Science.

68
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:47,866
We got them from our school.

69
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,299
This is
Bonnie, and that's Clyde.

70
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,499
They're our experiment.

71
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,100
Which is what?

72
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:52,999
Giving your
mother a heart attack?

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,366
No, actually,
rap music for Bonnie

74
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:56,499
and heavy metal for Clyde,

75
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,799
and then Cody writes down

76
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,199
a whole
bunch of scientific stuff.

77
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,199
You know, behavioral
changes, like eating habits,

78
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,099
mood swings, urination patterns.

79
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,366
Eww!

80
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,766
Why does it have to be rats?!

81
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:11,899
Too late now. We've bonded.

82
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,299
Swell.

83
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,466
Well, if you don't mind,

84
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:17,199
I'm going to take
Bonnie and Clyde away

85
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,867
from where we eat.

86
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:20,567
I'll get it.

87
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:24,566
No. Wait. What
if it's Mr. Moseby?

88
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:25,933
I'm toast.

89
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:27,700
Come in.

90
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,099
Look, Mr. Moseby, if this is
about the yo-yo, then I'm...

91
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,466
Oh, pish posh.

92
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:36,666
Boys will be boys. You
were just having fun,

93
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:38,099
and that's what
boys do, isn't it?

94
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,299
They have fun. Ha ha ha!

95
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,199
Did that yo-yo
bounce off your head?

96
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,599
No. I'm fine.

97
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,799
I came up here to
offer you scamps

98
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,199
tickets to today's Red Sox game.

99
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,599
It's a matinee.

100
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,099
The sox game? All right!

101
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,733
And your seats are
just above that little hut

102
00:03:57,734 --> 00:04:02,700
wherein the players spit
and scratch themselves.

103
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,733
Hold on.

104
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:06,299
There's something wrong here.

105
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,933
Why do you question
my generosity?

106
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:12,799
Yeah. Why do you
question his generosity?

107
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,366
I'll tell you what. You go.

108
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:17,766
I think I'll just stay
here and hang out

109
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:18,966
in the old lobby.

110
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,099
Where's my model rocket? Oh.

111
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,467
No!

112
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,600
All right, fine.

113
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:27,733
The hotel inspector
will be arriving soon,

114
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:31,399
and it would be marvelous
if you weren't around.

115
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,599
I knew it!

116
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,866
We'll be not around longer

117
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:37,400
if you throw in a
little money for dinner.

118
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:40,366
I like lobster.

119
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:43,667
Uh-huh. Ok, fine.

120
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,766
What are you doing?

121
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:47,666
I'm taking Clyde to the game.

122
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:48,999
You can't do that!

123
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,399
It'll contaminate
the experiment.

124
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,599
Who knows what <i>take
me out to the ballgame</i>

125
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,899
will do to his urinary pattern?

126
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,999
Fine, but this is why
they like me more

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,199
than they like you.

128
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,100
Come on, guys!

129
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:04,200
If we make batting practice,
I might meet a player!

130
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:10,400
Ok, I'll take you,
but don't tell Cody.

131
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,099
Oh, sorry, Bonnie.

132
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,199
I didn't know you'd
want to go, too.

133
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
How sexist of me.

134
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:25,733
When is the hotel
inspector going to be here?

135
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:27,799
Zack and Cody are
gonna be back any minute.

136
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,933
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Moseby.

137
00:05:28,934 --> 00:05:31,766
Per your instructions, I
am gluing down the vase.

138
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:34,699
Soon it'll be twinproof.

139
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,933
I have the most fantastic
idea for Ivana's party.

140
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:40,399
Canceling it?

141
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,733
Don't be silly.

142
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:46,900
I saw this fabulous painting
of dogs playing poker.

143
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:49,766
Ivana wants a poker party.

144
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:53,099
You do know those dogs
weren't really playing poker?

145
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,232
If they weren't playing poker,

146
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:58,799
how did that dalmatian
win all the money, huh?

147
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,366
Poker party it is.

148
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:02,100
Oh, yes!

149
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,899
Ohh!

150
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,467
Thank you, Esteban.

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,299
You can let go now.

152
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,766
I wish I could.

153
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:17,833
They don't call it
mega-glue for nothing.

154
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:19,833
Mr. Moseby?

155
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:20,700
That's right. May I help you?

156
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:26,099
I am Ilsa shikelgrubermiger,
the Tipton hotel inspector.

157
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,566
Yes, of course.

158
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,499
We were expecting you hours ago.

159
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,499
I got held up at Logan airport.

160
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:32,934
Traffic?

161
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,366
No. Their whole
luggage system stinks.

162
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:36,599
I had to redo it.

163
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,999
Welcome to the Tipton.

164
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,566
Mr. Moseby, do you realize
you are wearing a bellhop?

165
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:45,199
Very droll.

166
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,734
It goes with your
devastating good looks.

167
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,999
Are you staring at
my beauty Mark?

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,867
Yes. No.

169
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:55,032
Oh, would you stop that?

170
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:56,232
Yes, sir! Ow!

171
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:57,466
Let go!

172
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:00,367
If I could just... let me...

173
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:08,599
Ooh, I love the
vest look on you, sir.

174
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,999
But like your sleeves, I am off.

175
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,499
Might I explain?

176
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,799
Hey, Mr. Moseby.
The sox won 10 to 9.

177
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,299
And mom caught a foul ball.

178
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,466
Yeah, apparently heads
up means heads down.

179
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:25,599
So is the evil hotel
inspector gone yet?

180
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,999
No. She's right here.

181
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,700
Whoa! What's that on your face?

182
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:36,699
It's a beauty Mark.

183
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,800
But it has a hair
on it. I mean...

184
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:43,866
It's a good thing I
don't have triplets.

185
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:45,199
I've run out of hands.

186
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,566
Thanks again for the
tickets to the game.

187
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,100
Yeah, thanks.

188
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,666
We know they're
usually for the guests,

189
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:50,866
so we really appreciate it.

190
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:54,499
Oh, ignores guest
needs for friends.

191
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,966
They're not my friends. Oh.

192
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:58,666
Ignores guest
needs for strangers.

193
00:07:58,667 --> 00:07:59,300
Ugh!

194
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:01,399
What kind of hotel
manager are you?

195
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,766
He's the best. He's number one.

196
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:07,032
Yeah, last week, he let us
cook s'mores in the kitchen,

197
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:09,666
and then he put out
the fire all by himself.

198
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,099
Ok!

199
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,833
Mr. Moseby, I have
been here 5 minutes,

200
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:14,933
and I am not impressed.

201
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:19,099
I assure you, there will
be no more surprises.

202
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,100
Aah! Rats!

203
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:29,232
Starting now.

204
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:32,933
Mr. Moseby, in my 20
years as a hotel inspector,

205
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:35,466
I have never been so appalled.

206
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:37,599
Rats in the lobby? Yeah, but...

207
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,300
Dut, dut, dut!

208
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:40,899
I am taking over the
management of this hotel

209
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,232
until a review board arrives
to make their final decision.

210
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,899
Your Tipton hotel keys.

211
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,099
Not his keys.

212
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,666
Your gold-plated Tipton badge.

213
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,566
Not the badge!

214
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,666
Your Tipton tie.

215
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,766
I feel compelled to disclose

216
00:08:56,767 --> 00:09:00,599
that I am wearing custom-made
Tipton boxer shorts.

217
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,500
Dry-clean them
and send them back.

218
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,599
Oh, poor Mr. Moseby.

219
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,233
Yeah.

220
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:20,499
But what are the odds
there are 2 rats downstairs

221
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,200
and we have 2 rats upstairs?

222
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,466
They are upstairs, aren't they?

223
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,799
Well... oh!

224
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,466
I mean, they were in my pocket
when we got back from the game.

225
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:37,199
They must've snuck out
when we got to the hotel.

226
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,766
You ruined our
science experiment.

227
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:40,500
And more importantly,

228
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:42,499
you may have ruined Mr. Moseby.

229
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,199
Zack, you better think
about you just did.

230
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,900
You may have
cost the man his job.

231
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,699
Here, Bonnie. Here, Clyde.

232
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,232
It's been a whole week.

233
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:57,933
I don't think this
cheese is working.

234
00:09:57,934 --> 00:10:01,700
Muriel, what is this?

235
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,466
Mmm! Gorgonzola.

236
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:10,133
You want some? There's
more under the couch.

237
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,966
Esteban! Yes, sir.

238
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:14,900
Ma'am.

239
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:16,999
What is that nonregulation pin

240
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,599
you are wearing on
your Tipton uniform?

241
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,099
It belonged to my
great-grandfather

242
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,466
who died fighting for my
country's independence.

243
00:10:23,467 --> 00:10:26,999
How touching. Take it off.

244
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,366
I'm watching you.

245
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:31,966
Man, I never thought
I'd miss Moseby.

246
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,099
Yeah, she's a real witch.

247
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,400
I'd love to vacuum
off that mole.

248
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:43,299
You there, candy girl.

249
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,099
My name's Maddie.

250
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,966
<i>Ja, </i>candy girl.

251
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:50,299
I see you punched in at 4:01.

252
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,366
You were supposed
to be here at 4:00

253
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:54,966
to work on London's
poochie party.

254
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:56,599
Sorry.

255
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,099
4:00 means 4:00.

256
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,466
I am docking you
for that minute.

257
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:01,999
Th-that's a dime.

258
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,800
A dime you'll never see!

259
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,933
Man, getting
Mr. Moseby suspended

260
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,399
was the worst thing
we've ever done.

261
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,599
And by "we," you mean you?

262
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,799
Now, I'm gonna go
over there and talk to her.

263
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,133
If things don't go well, I
want you to have my yo-yo.

264
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:26,199
Excuse me, miss
shikel-geiger counter...

265
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,400
Close enough. What?

266
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,299
What are you staring at?

267
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,399
Nothing.

268
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,966
I just wanted to
say that the rat thing

269
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,899
was not Mr. Moseby's fault.

270
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,999
It was my fault.

271
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,366
Well, that changes
things. Really?

272
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:47,499
No!

273
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,566
A manager is
responsible for everything

274
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:52,099
that happens in a hotel.
The buck stops here.

275
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,833
Speaking of which,
I want the two of you

276
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:57,566
to stop coming in the
front entrance Willy-nilly.

277
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,933
But Mr. Moseby always lets us...

278
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:00,766
Mr. Moseby doesn't
work here anymore.

279
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,132
But we need... dut, dut, dut!

280
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:03,967
End of conversation.

281
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,100
It's been 31 minutes.
That pizza is free!

282
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,599
Hello, Mr. Moseby.

283
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,733
Zack.

284
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:21,966
Wow, your apartment is
decorated just like the Tipton lobby.

285
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:24,833
There was a 2-for-1 sale.

286
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:26,566
What brings you here?

287
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,866
You gotta come back, Mr. Moseby.

288
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:30,733
Ilsa's a nightmare.

289
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:31,933
I'm sorry to hear that,

290
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:33,499
but there is nothing
that I can do.

291
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,833
I've been suspended.

292
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,399
Now, I hope you
enjoyed your stay

293
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,399
at the Moseby apartment.

294
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,966
You can't give up.

295
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,899
The Tipton is your whole life.

296
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,999
Not necessarily. I
have other interests.

297
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,232
I've always wanted to
learn to drive the big rigs.

298
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:53,466
Breaker, breaker,
pedal to the metal!

299
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:55,466
But we need you
back, and I'll promise

300
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:58,733
I'll never bring a rodent
through the lobby again.

301
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:00,099
That was you?

302
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,299
Yes, and I'm sorry.

303
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,232
I'm totally, completely,
absolutely sorry,

304
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:06,934
really, really sorry.

305
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,766
Thank you for coming up
here and telling me that,

306
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:12,366
but if you'll excuse
me, I am in the middle

307
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:15,600
of a very important project.

308
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,233
That's the Tipton.

309
00:13:18,234 --> 00:13:21,799
Mm-hmm. 1/100th scale.

310
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,733
Wow, you got the tip just right.

311
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:29,566
Don't... Touch that.

312
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,000
Sorry?

313
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:37,566
I don't understand.

314
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,466
I went and apologized
to Mr. Moseby,

315
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,366
but things still
aren't any better.

316
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:43,833
Well, it's good that
you apologized,

317
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,366
but that doesn't
always fix everything.

318
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,232
That stinks.

319
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:49,100
That's life.

320
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:52,833
Sometimes it takes more
than just saying you're sorry.

321
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:56,299
Try to get some sleep, ok?

322
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,566
Ok.

323
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:59,232
I love you.

324
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,000
Love you, too.

325
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:10,133
Bonnie, Clyde, thank
goodness you're back!

326
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:16,233
Cody, wake up.

327
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:17,967
Are we moving again?

328
00:14:17,968 --> 00:14:21,499
No, look who came
back. Bonnie and Clyde.

329
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,000
Yes!

330
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:24,099
Oh, thank goodness we found them

331
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,100
before the dog party.

332
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:26,999
That would have been a disaster.

333
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,299
Yeah, the kind that'll
get a manager fired.

334
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,499
Cody, it's a brilliant plan!

335
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,367
Thanks.

336
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:36,834
What's my plan again?

337
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:39,600
Hello?

338
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:41,933
Is this the cat lovers society?

339
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:44,032
Is this the head cat?

340
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,599
Well, you and your entire group

341
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,299
have just won a free
weekend at the Tipton hotel.

342
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,100
Th-that's right.

343
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:53,100
Bring as many
kitties as you'd like.

344
00:14:53,867 --> 00:14:55,367
Yeah!

345
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:59,299
Look who's been
assigned to a new room.

346
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,600
Everybody!

347
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:07,499
Oh, boy.

348
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,933
Dut, dut, dut, dut!

349
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:11,600
Put a lederhosen in it, Blondie.

350
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,933
Esteban, what is going
on with the computer?

351
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:16,999
I don't know. Every
time I push a button,

352
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,666
I get a picture of a koala bear.

353
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,299
Ooh, and he's doing a dance!

354
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,833
Look how cute.

355
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:23,999
Have you tried to restart it?

356
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,199
Only Mr. Moseby knows
how. I've tried everything.

357
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,699
Have you tried this?

358
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,366
Oh, you have broken it.

359
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:32,800
Ohh!

360
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:37,299
What is going on out here?

361
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,999
You're disturbing Ivana's party.

362
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,799
They're playing
spin the milk-bone.

363
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,733
I don't have time for your
petty puppy problems.

364
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:46,966
Grr! Grr!

365
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:49,099
Ha! You don't scare me.

366
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,199
I once bit a shark.

367
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,467
London, we have a problem.

368
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,366
What are you doing out here?

369
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:58,499
You're supposed to be making

370
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,299
balloon people for the dogs.

371
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,599
I've had it! 2 of
your guests bit me,

372
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,966
and one went tinkle on my leg!

373
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:09,099
No! Don't make
me go back in there!

374
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,299
Excuse me.

375
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,499
Excuse me. We're here
for the cat lovers convention.

376
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,200
The what?

377
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:16,599
We were promised free rooms

378
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,999
and complimentary litter boxes.

379
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Let me check that for you.

380
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,666
I can't seem to find it.

381
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,199
Phase one complete.

382
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,367
Get Moseby here.

383
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,232
Tipton ho... Moseby residence.

384
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:40,833
Mr. Moseby, it's Zack!

385
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:41,567
You gotta get over here.

386
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:44,099
The place is going
crazy, and we need you!

387
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,366
I'm sure Ilsa can handle it.

388
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:48,866
Oh, no, the water
is up to my neck!

389
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:51,133
Losing... air... fast.

390
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,399
There's water in my hotel?

391
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,834
Take your sticking paws
off me, you dirty ape!

392
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:02,099
There are apes in my hotel?

393
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,666
Help! There's an angry mob
running through the lobby!

394
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:06,700
L-look out!

395
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:12,500
The Tipton needs
me. I'm coming, mama!

396
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:26,099
On to phase 3: Release the rats.

397
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,899
Bonnie, Clyde, we've
gone over the plan.

398
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,132
You know what to do.

399
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:35,300
Remember, we're
doing this for Moseby.

400
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,367
Aah!

401
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,299
For the love of schnitzel.

402
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,899
This may be our best work ever.

403
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,866
Only if it gets Moseby back.

404
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:26,099
Miss shikelgrubermiger,

405
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,032
I am martino guistefester.

406
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:30,833
Ambrose lippencollarman,
Bob Smith.

407
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:31,367
Oh!

408
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:33,733
From the Tipton review board.

409
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:35,999
Is there any way
you could come back,

410
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,934
mm, not now?

411
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,232
Get this mangy mutt off of me!

412
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,866
Stop.

413
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:46,767
Bad dog. No.

414
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,700
Good gracious! What
is going on here?!

415
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,300
Perfect timing.

416
00:18:57,734 --> 00:18:59,500
Dogs, halt!

417
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:02,799
Wait! Stop! You
forgot your doggy bags!

418
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,467
Sit.

419
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,967
Now go back to your party.
There's nothing to see here.

420
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

421
00:19:17,301 --> 00:19:18,699
may I have your
attention, please?

422
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,833
All of your complaints will
be handled immediately.

423
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:24,800
Ah, Mr. Takimoto.

424
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,967
, mademoiselle Chantal.

425
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,567
Ah, Mr. Moombassa.

426
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,866
Cool.

427
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:41,599
Esteban!

428
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,133
Yes, your majesty?

429
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:44,699
I want gift baskets for each
of these guests immediately.

430
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,566
Oh, and some catnip
for our feline friends.

431
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:48,899
Oh, for you, anything.

432
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,499
And for you, bubkes.

433
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,799
Mr. Moseby, on behalf
of the Tipton review board,

434
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,499
I must say I am very impressed.

435
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,799
Well, thank you, sir.

436
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,567
I'll have you know

437
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:02,733
I had everything under control.

438
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,232
Not from where we stand.

439
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:06,032
I think this review is done.

440
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:08,499
You obviously cannot
inspire loyalty in staff,

441
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,299
and you certainly are
not fit to run a hotel.

442
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,399
This isn't a hotel!

443
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,766
This is a circus with dogs

444
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:18,999
and cats and rats
and clowns and twins.

445
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,766
The only thing missing
is a bearded lady.

446
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:23,600
Watch it.

447
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:27,132
You would have to be out
of your mind to work here.

448
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:29,399
Well, then call me crazy.

449
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,199
Mr. Moseby, please
continue your fine work.

450
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,366
Ms. Shikelgrubermiger,
your Tipton keys,

451
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:41,766
your nametag, and your pen.

452
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:43,367
Aah!

453
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,032
No hard feelings?

454
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:49,733
Psych!

455
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:52,032
I'll get you next
time, Mr. Moseby,

456
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:54,700
and your little dog, too!

457
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,600
Dut, dut, dut!

458
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:06,566
Was all of this your doing?

459
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:07,500
It was Zack.

460
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:09,366
I'm sorry, Mr. Moseby.

461
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:10,866
So, you engineered this mayhem,

462
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:13,999
nearly destroying my
hotel in the process?

463
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,299
Yes, I did.

464
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,500
I just have one thing to
say to you, young man.

465
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:22,699
Thank you.

466
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,232
My pleasure.

467
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:28,499
Hey, hey, I helped
destroy the hotel, too.

468
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,299
You know, boys, next week,
the health inspector's coming.

469
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,499
You ever been to New York?

470
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,199
Throw in Yankees
tickets, and we're there.

471
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,500
Oh, please.

472
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:49,099
I'm gonna see your bet...

473
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,366
And raise you 2.

474
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:54,299
Oh, hush up.

475
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,500
Put your bones in or fold.

476
00:21:57,767 --> 00:22:01,834
Ha ha ha! Roll over and weep!
