just caught a bus.

494
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,720
Ok.

495
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,823
What have you done?!

496
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,124
Mom!
Mom!

497
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:31,662
I am surprised at you 2
and you 2, too!

498
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:33,296
They didn't do it.

499
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:35,466
They were the only 2
that stayed to help.

500
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,101
Guys? Hello?
Come on!

501
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:39,437
It wasn't us.

502
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,939
It was that kid drew.

503
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:43,841
I told you
he was no good.

504
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,844
You...Said...Nothing!

505
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,413
I don't care
who did it.

506
00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:51,047
Pull!

507
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:52,383
It's still
your responsibility.

508
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,917
Pull!

509
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,952
When I told you
this hotel is your home,

510
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:57,288
I meant you should
treat it with respect.

511
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,323
Pull!

512
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:01,358
Sorry. I guess
I messed up.

513
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,659
That's right.

514
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,162
He messed up.

515
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:07,665
Pull!

516
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,901
Ooh! 4:00 ice cream.

517
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,105
Guys, guys!

518
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:17,708
Aw, come on, help!

519
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:21,111
Oh, man, I picked
the wrong day to wear heels.

520
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:28,118
You know, moseby,

521
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:30,254
you run a nice place
around here.

522
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:31,989
Thanks, son.

523
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:32,990
I'm a girl.

524
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:34,425
Mm-hmm.

525
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,995
Cody: THIS IS THE WORST
PUNISHMENT WE EVER GOT!

526
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:42,833
I think we scrubbed
every single tile.

527
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,668
I can't uncurl my fingers.

528
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:48,305
Hey, Max! Max, I finally
learned that move.

529
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:51,141
[Hip-hop playing]

530
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:57,714
I don't know her.

531
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:38,472
Neither do I.
