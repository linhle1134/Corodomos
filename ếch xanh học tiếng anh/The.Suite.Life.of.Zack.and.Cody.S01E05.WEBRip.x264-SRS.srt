1
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:12,010
Love ya.

2
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,979
Hey, Bobby. Thanks.
Thank you.

3
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:15,480
Great show.
Thank you.

4
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,382
Hey, cute guy.

5
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:18,850
Third table
from the left.

6
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,618
My left,
not your--hi.

7
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:21,620
Hi.

8
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:23,388
Gangway. Coming through.
Watch out.

9
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:24,389
Zack, what
are you doing?

10
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:25,723
Winning.

11
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:28,160
Excuse me. Hi, mom.

12
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,395
Cody!

13
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,096
Stop. Right now.

14
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,998
I hope you don't mind.
I have kids.

15
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:34,433
Hello?

16
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:35,434
Cody: LOOK OUT.

17
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,168
Look out!
I can't stop.

18
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,170
Unh.

19
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,370
What is
going on?

20
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:41,006
If it's not one
thing, it's--

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,240
mama!

22
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:42,474
Aah!

23
00:00:48,747 --> 00:00:51,015
Mr. moseby, are you ok?

24
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,117
Here at the tipton,

25
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:53,585
it's the guest
that matters,

26
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:54,886
not the manager.

27
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,422
Look what you guys did.

28
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:59,724
You broke Mr. moseby.

29
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,294
You are so grounded.

30
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,563
When you say
grounded,

31
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,265
does that include
the pool and gym?

32
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:09,735
ON THE 23rd FLOOR.

33
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:10,969
Mr. moseby, I'm sorry.

34
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,505
I won't let them down here
for a long, long time.

35
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:14,939
Till they go to college.

36
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,175
Or prison.

37
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,979
Oy. Ohh.

38
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:26,951
Guys, just once would it
kill you to behave?

39
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,621
Both: UHH.

Zack: IT'S THERE.

55
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,106
No, it isn't.

56
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,774
Yes, it is.

57
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:23,975
Right there.
Are you blind?

58
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,477
You can totally feel it.

59
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:27,746
Ow, you pulled the skin.

60
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,483
That's 'cause
there's no hair there.

61
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:33,752
And no deodorant.

62
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,754
Aw, you're looking
for armpit hair.

63
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:37,822
Both: MOM!

64
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,191
My little boys are
becoming little men.

65
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,592
You should really knock.

66
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:43,027
We don't walk in on you.

67
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,463
Actually, you
do.

68
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,199
And you bring
friends.

69
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:49,801
Quit it!

70
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:51,269
Look, we've got to
talk about last night.

71
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,404
We do not want
a repeat

72
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,806
of the dream valley
lodge incident.

73
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,542
I swear I thought
it was a black cat

74
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,779
with a white stripe.

75
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,113
Here's a thought.

76
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,681
What do you say
we keep this job

77
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:04,950
and get you
a babysitter?

78
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,418
Babysitter?

79
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,220
W-wait, you just said
we were little men.

80
00:03:09,254 --> 00:03:11,590
Ok. A little men sitter.

81
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,926
I was thinking maybe maddie
who works in the gift shop.

82
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,761
She needs the money.

83
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:18,263
Ooh. Maddie.

84
00:03:18,297 --> 00:03:21,766
Baby's got it
going on.

85
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,037
She's got what
going where?

86
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:29,374
I don't know
what I'm saying.

87
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,743
Yeah, you better not.

88
00:03:31,777 --> 00:03:32,710
He doesn't.

89
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,345
Yes, I do.
No, you don't.

90
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,847
Yes, I do.

91
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,082
Mr. moseby.
Good morning.

92
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,549
What a surprise.

93
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:41,619
Both: GOOD MORNING,
Mr. MOSEBY.

94
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:43,922
What brings you up
so early?

95
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:45,423
Couldn't sleep.

96
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:47,992
Nightmares.

97
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:51,729
Actually, I am here
to discuss your bill.

98
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,731
What bill?

99
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,398
Room and board
are part of my deal.

100
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:56,001
Yes, only
you have exceeded

101
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,403
your first month's
allowance by...

102
00:03:58,437 --> 00:04:01,539
[Gasps]

103
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:02,774
Breathe!

104
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:04,409
Breathe, mom. Breathe.

105
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:07,245
[Gasps]

106
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:09,280
Oh, my.

107
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,316
Mr. moseby,
you can't be serious.

108
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,686
I am powerless
to be otherwise.

109
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,221
I don't know
how this happened.

110
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,355
Man: ROOM SERVICE!

111
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:19,124
Somebody ordered
the "I'm sorry

112
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,526
for what we did
last night" buffet.

113
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,129
Eggs Benedict
with caviar?

114
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,630
Must be
a mistake.

115
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:28,734
We ordered toast
and a raisin.

116
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,837
You guys are
bleeding me dry here.

117
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,638
Oh, my mistake.

118
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:34,906
This was meant
for the other mommy

119
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,309
WITH TWINS
ON THE 23rd FLOOR.

120
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,311
Uh, I'm sorry.

121
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,411
I didn't--I mean
they--they were--

122
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,080
I understand.

123
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,550
Children sometimes
can be a burden.

124
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,852
You have kids?

125
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:49,988
No, and after seeing
yours, not gonna happen.

126
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,830
Video games,
pay per view--

127
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:01,466
you had your underwear
dry-cleaned?

128
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,534
Feels good.

129
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,504
Sit.

130
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,838
Now, look, guys.

131
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:08,472
We may live
in a palace,

132
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,141
but we're
not royalty.

133
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,477
I think
you're a queen, mommy.

134
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:15,813
Aw.
Put a sock in it.

135
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,014
Come on, guys.

136
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:18,249
This is the best gig
we've ever had,

137
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,118
and without it,
we're broke.

138
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:21,752
With it,
we're broke.

139
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:23,488
Don't you guys
realize

140
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:26,557
what a great opportunity
this is for us?

141
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,059
I don't have to go out
on the road any more.

142
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,594
We can all
be together.

143
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:32,564
Yeah, I like it better
here than at grandma's.

144
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:36,034
Yeah. Last time,
she dropped her false teeth

145
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:38,269
in my chocolate milk.

146
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:41,239
I rest my case.

147
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:43,007
So, please, be good.

148
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,642
Both: WE WILL.

149
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,345
Man: HEY,
NO PHOTOGRAPHERS.

150
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,346
Hey, we live here.

151
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,081
I live here, too.

152
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:51,415
Hey, check it out.

153
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,251
I found 5 bucks
in my pocket.

154
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,220
Those are my pants.

155
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,956
Cool. Candy's on you. Ok.

156
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,024
Let's hitch a ride.

157
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:02,060
Shotgun.

158
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:03,695
Driver,
to the candy shop.

159
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:05,296
You got it.

160
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,065
Shouldn't we
give the money to mom?

161
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,000
Not until she learns to
manage money better.

162
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:11,936
We're broke.

163
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,104
Hey, maddie.

164
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:15,006
I want 2 zabbabbas,
a sweetie tweetie,

165
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,608
and 7-foot
licorice chain.

166
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:17,475
I see
you're cutting down.

167
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,146
So, guys, I've completely
reorganized the candy display.

168
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,482
Now, tell me,
what draws your eye?

169
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,252
You do, sweet thing.

170
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,622
Please. Some of this candy
is older than you.

171
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,857
Moseby: PAPARAZZI!

172
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:35,627
I can smell them.

173
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:43,435
Whoa.

174
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,802
What's
going on here?

175
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,203
They're waiting
for Bobby carillo,

176
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,738
center fielder
for the sox,

177
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:50,441
and Ursula
the lingerie model.

178
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:51,976
They're getting married
here on Saturday.

179
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,579
Dude, he's the best player ever.

180
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:56,948
And she's real good
at what she does.

181
00:06:56,982 --> 00:07:02,354
Oh, yeah. Takes real brains to sit
on a horse in your underwear.

182
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,323
[All talking at once]

183
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:08,927
I mean, what
is the big deal?

184
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:09,928
Money, baby.

185
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,862
Tuck.

186
00:07:11,897 --> 00:07:13,899
Hi.

187
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,101
What does he have
that I don't have?

188
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,502
Armpit hair.

189
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:22,607
Word on the street is the
tabloids are paying $20,000

190
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,511
for a shot of the bride
and groom's first kiss.

191
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:29,781
You are so plugged in.

192
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:32,584
This hotel doesn't
run without me.

193
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,088
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

194
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:40,458
Yeah!
What are you thinkin'?

195
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:42,260
We can take a
picture of the kiss

196
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:43,661
and we'll be rich.

197
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,797
We can pay mom back.

198
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,031
And we'll be rich.

199
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,666
We won't be burdens
anymore.

200
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,734
And we'll be rich.

201
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:52,804
And whatever's left,
we can give to charity.

202
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:55,874
I swear,
we're not related.

203
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:59,343
Maddie,
I need a camera,

204
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,346
and charge it,
please.

205
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,448
Candy.

206
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,858
Thank you.

207
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:17,228
Both: WE'RE RICH. WE'RE RICH.
WE'RE RICH.

208
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:20,565
Not quite.
Not quite.

209
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,500
Nobody is getting
into that wedding

210
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,135
without
a printed invitation.

211
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:27,972
HERE I AM. LITTLE
ME, BACK FROM<i>  Paris.</i>

212
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,975
Hello, maddie.

213
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:32,610
Hi, London.

214
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,746
So, how are you getting
into the wedding?

215
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,982
My daddy owns
the hotel. Duh.

216
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,883
Can you
get us in?

217
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:43,955
Yes, but I'm
not going to. Duh.

218
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:45,122
I fly solo.

219
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,292
Oh, yeah. Like that time
you let yourself

220
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,594
into that rock star's
room with the master key.

221
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:51,663
Johnny rip thought
it was endearing.

222
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,997
He even wrote me.

223
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:56,968
That was
a restraining order.

224
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,837
Look, I'm going
to that wedding.

225
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,673
I'll be on the cover
of this magazine,

226
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,709
and you'll be
selling it. Duh.

227
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,782
We're never
gonna get in here.

228
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,884
There will be security
at every door.

229
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:16,787
Moseby: AND THIS
IS THE BALLROOM.

230
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:17,755
This way.

231
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,291
Which we will
magically transform

232
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:22,727
into your
wedding chapel.

233
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:23,694
Oh, my.

234
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,662
Where will
beyonc sing

235
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:25,697
during
the ceremony?

236
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,166
Copenhagen.

237
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,635
Her tour
has been extended.

238
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:32,403
You know how the danes
like to get down.

239
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,306
♪ Harunky dunky dunky ♪

240
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,680
I am sick of divas.

241
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,148
Can't we just
have a nobody singer

242
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:45,449
who will
actually show up?

243
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,918
We know
a nobody singer.

244
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,119
It's our mom.

245
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,221
She's a huge nobody.

246
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:52,290
But I'm sure she's
stretched way too thin

247
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,625
with her show
and policing you.

248
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,060
She could handle it.

249
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,828
Come on.
She's rehearsin' now.

250
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:58,863
Uh, uh, but--

251
00:09:58,897 --> 00:09:59,864
you'll love her.

252
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:01,366
She wears
your underwear,

253
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,434
but she looks
a lot different.

254
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,506
♪ To get through it
all ♪

255
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,844
♪ just sing ♪

256
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,614
♪ just sing ♪

257
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,183
She's great.
She's great.

258
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,183
Isn't she great?

259
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:20,451
Ms. Martin's marvelous.

260
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,487
Everything at the tipton
is marvelous.

261
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,390
Wow, I don't know
how to thank you.

262
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,591
Thank your agents.

263
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,560
Ok. Let's get you
2 lovebirds out of here

264
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,461
without causing a riot,
shall we?

265
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,762
She's perfect.

266
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,131
Ohh.

267
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,766
Whatever you want,
you got it.

268
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Get us
into the wedding.

269
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:38,035
Except that.

270
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:39,404
You're grounded,
remember?

271
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,972
You meant that?

272
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:43,207
I'm doing
the right thing.

273
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:49,480
Ok. We're just gonna
have to find a way

274
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,148
into that wedding
ourselves.

275
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:52,183
Forget it.

276
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:54,218
There is no way
you are talking me

277
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:56,521
into another one of
your idiotic schemes.

278
00:10:58,123 --> 00:10:59,657
Mad dog to bird dog.

279
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:01,693
Are you in position?

280
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:02,694
Affirmative.

281
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,662
I have located
the mezzanine vent.

282
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:07,365
Hopefully, this one
leads to the ballroom.

283
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,266
It better because
mad dog needs

284
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,103
to find a fire
hydrant and quick.

285
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:14,638
Roger. I'm sending
down the probe.

286
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:15,940
You mean
the golf ball?

287
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,176
Yes, the golf ball.

288
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,350
Bingo. We found it,
bird dog.

289
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,187
And what
have we found?

290
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:33,290
Uh...

291
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:33,991
My 2-way.

292
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:40,331
Radio: GET OUT OF THERE BEFORE
LARD BUTT MOSEBY SEES YOU.

293
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,701
Can I just...

294
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:47,204
Bird dog,
this is lard butt.

295
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,308
You do anything
to disrupt this wedding,

296
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,509
and it will be
the last song

297
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,978
your mother ever sings
at the tipton.

298
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:56,447
Over and
you're almost out.

299
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:13,598
No, a dromedary is
not a play about milk.

300
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,601
Ta-da!

301
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:19,837
Well,
what do you think?

302
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,005
And be brutal.

303
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,608
Anyone looks at you
and they think...25.

304
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:25,610
And?

305
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,044
And never
had a kid.

306
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,981
Yes! I've trained
them so well.

307
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,315
Ok, now, you gonna
stay in the room

308
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:32,650
and do everything
maddie says?

309
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:33,684
Yep.
Good.

310
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,554
Don't believe them.

311
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,089
Ok, guys. Hey.

312
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,957
Double kisses.

313
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,527
Good-bye
and good night.

314
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,495
Carey: LOVE YOU.

315
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,397
Both: LOVE YOU.

316
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,101
Well, I'm gonna
take my bath now.

317
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:52,703
And I'm going
to brush my teeth

318
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:55,573
to prevent
dental decay and--

319
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,043
I have one question
about this.

320
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:00,545
What if we get caught?

321
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,647
Moseby will fire mom.

322
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:06,951
Who cares?

323
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,720
With 20 grand, we
could buy the hotel

324
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:09,921
and fire moseby.

325
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,888
Good point.

326
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:11,689
Now I need
exactly 35 minutes

327
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:15,293
to get there, get the picture
of the kiss, and get back.

328
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,861
Right. You wanna
synchronize watches?

329
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:17,962
I don't
have a watch.

330

We wanted to pay you
back the money.

496
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,125
We wanted to stop
being burdens.

497
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,333
Come here.

498
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:11,068
I was trying
to stop them.

499
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:15,406
Better men than you
have tried.

500
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,907
Now, listen.

501
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,575
You're not
burdens, ok?

502
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,577
It's my job to make
the money, not yours.

503
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,180
Your job is to be the
kids and have fun.

504
00:21:23,214 --> 00:21:24,548
And parents take
care of children.

505
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:27,017
Children don't take
care of parents,

506
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:29,053
even if they are
becoming little men.

507
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,054
Understand?

508
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,889
Yep. Sorry.

509
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,457
Maybe I did come
on kinda strong

510
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:34,992
about the whole
being broke thing.

511
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,927
I really shouldn't have
worried you like that.

512
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,864
I was...Wrong.

513
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:41,198
So, what you're
really saying is

514
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:45,435
this is all your fault and
we're not really punished?

515
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,539
Nice try.

516
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,741
Yeah, you're grounded
for another week.

517
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:52,009
When you say grounded--

518
00:21:52,043 --> 00:21:54,411
ON THE 23rd FLOOR.

519
00:21:54,445 --> 00:21:56,646
Race ya upstairs.
Go!

520
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:57,648
Hey!

521
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:59,082
Don't run!
Don't run!

522
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,851
Look out!

523
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:40,107
No!
