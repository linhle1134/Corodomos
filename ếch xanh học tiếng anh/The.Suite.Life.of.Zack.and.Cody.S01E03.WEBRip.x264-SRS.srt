1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,738
Oh, my.

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:07,806
Hey, man.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,608
Yo...Dudes.

4
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:11,009
Huh?
I don't know.

5
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:15,614
Mm-mmm, look what the hunk
fairy just dropped off.

6
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,715
Jason harrington
and Kyle lawford.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,784
Gloss me.

8
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,520
Sorry. We're watching
the counter for maddie.

9
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:27,426
We're not allowed to accept money, make
change, or touch any of the merchandise.

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,560
Is there anything
you can do?

11
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:32,731
I can shove 12 gummi worms up my nose.
You wanna see?

12
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:36,301
Oh, there you are.
Where have you been?

13
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,603
Never mind.
Gloss me, candy girl.

14
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,639
Off the clock.

15
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:42,607
Thanks, guys.

16
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,443
No problem,
sweet thing.

17
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:48,246
Aw...
Call me in 10 years.

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,548
London?

19
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,552
Kyle.
Hey.

20
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,719
Small world.

21
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,855
Hi. I'm Jason.

22
00:00:56,889 --> 00:01:01,192
Hi. I'm, um...
Uh...

23
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:03,027
Maddie.

24
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,963
What he said.

25
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:07,332
So, do you come to
the tipton hotel often?

26
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:10,068
It's like I live here.

27
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,870
So, Kyle, you in town
for the Usher concert?

28
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,941
Semester break. Our parents
arrive from Aspen tomorrow,

29
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,509
then we fly to Bermuda.

30
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,477
Our moms lost their tans
skiing.

31
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:23,481
Oh...I hate
when that happens.

32
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:28,520
Well, as we say, gotta jet.
Nice to meet you.

33
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:29,988
You don't really
like that guy, do you?

34
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:32,991
He's cute, but I've worked here
long enough to know his type.

35
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:37,095
Rich people don't care about
anything but themselves.

36
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,097
Whoa, hey, man,
recycle that.

37
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:41,399
You serious?

38
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:45,170
You recycle?

39
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:48,240
Sure, bottles,
cans, newspapers.

40
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,307
Since when?

41
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,676
Since my father
bought Oregon

42
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,712
and started
chopping down the trees.

43
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,213
You heard of octicorp?

44
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:57,048
The center of all evil?

45
00:01:57,082 --> 00:01:58,516
That's dad.

46
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,118
I protest against them.

47
00:02:00,152 --> 00:02:01,253
Me, too.

48
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,921
I got dragged off by a cop.

49
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:05,924
I got grounded for 2 weeks.

50
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,625
I recycle, too.

51
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:08,593
Really?

52
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,930

Oh, Kyle, Jason, I got us
tickets to see Usher.

68
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:04,048
Front row. So close,
he'll probably sweat on us.

69
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,450
Awesome.
Excuse me.

70
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:08,586
Hey, maddie.
Hi.

71
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,488
What is that all about?

72
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,423
She's all he could
talk about last night.

73
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:15,327
Oh, please. They are so
not right for each other.

74
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,863
I don't know.
They're both rich.

75
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,265
What? Oh, he thought--

76
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:22,868
ha! I don't wanna burst
any bubbles,

77
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,135
but it's so much fun.

78
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,272
♪ London, a word ♪

79
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:31,143
I couldn't help
overhearing your plan.

80
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,946
Oh, good. Then you'll have the
hotel limo ready by 8:00?

81
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:39,751
Love to, except
your father saw this...

82
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,689
And memoed me,
"no more of these."

83
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,090
But--but--
no "buts."

84
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,892
It is unseemly
that a girl your age

85
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,028
be out alone with 2 boys.

86
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:51,930
But...

87
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:53,665
I'm not going alone.

88
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:54,566
Maddie's coming.

89
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,271
And nobody's gonna have any
real fun with maddie around.

90
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,072
Good point.

91
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,576
Excuse me.

92
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:06,111
What are you doing?

93
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:09,847
I'm inviting you to see Usher
with me, Kyle, and Jason.

94
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,683
Why?

95
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:14,853
Because I'm nice, duh.

96
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,321
Ok. Moseby
won't let me go

97
00:04:16,355 --> 00:04:20,758
unless I bring along a guaranteed killjoy.
So what do you say?

98
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,094
As heartfelt
as that offer is,

99
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,030
no.

100
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,799
Oh, come on. Kyle
says Jason likes you.

101
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,603
Really? Rich guys
don't date poor girls.

102
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:34,072
Why would Jason
wanna go out with me?

103
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:36,508
Well, you're smart and cute,

104
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,043
he obviously doesn't mind
girls with big feet,

105
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,411
and he thinks you're rich.

106
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,848
No wonder he's
paying attention to me.

107
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:45,349
I'll go
set him straight.

108
00:04:45,384 --> 00:04:48,119
No. Just play along.
Please?

109
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:49,888
It's only for one night.

110
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,757
Front-row seats.

111
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,159
Backstage passes.

112
00:04:54,193 --> 00:05:00,165
You get to ride in a limo
that's not following a hearse.

113
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,832
We get to meet Usher?

114
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:05,136
Sweetie,
Usher gets to meet us.

115
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:08,139
Just call me princess.

116
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:13,011
This whole night
has been so awesome.

117
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:13,845
Look, I'm a vip.

118
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:18,183
You know, you're amazing. It's
like this is all new to you--

119
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:22,386
front-row seats, meeting
celebrities, riding in limos.

120
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:22,821
Yeah, well,
I never get tired

121
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:27,292
of sticking my head out of the
sunroof and yelling, "whoo!"

122
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,296
Did you just hear somebody
go, "whoo"?

123
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,365
It must be maddie.
Get down.

124
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,935
I have an idea. Let's
all go to the rooftop,

125
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,404
except for maddie
and Jason.

126
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:46,310
So, uh, I guess
I should say good-bye.

127
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:50,214
Or you could invite me
into your suite.

128
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,150
My suite what?

129
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:56,321
Oh, my suite... in the
hotel where I live

130
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,422
because I'm rich.

131
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:59,590
No, you can't come in.

132
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,193
I think that creep's
trying to kiss her.

133
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:05,564
Man, if I was 5 years older
and 2 feet taller.

134
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,666
I'd be squashed.

135
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,437
So you're leaving tomorrow?
Well, I guess we should...

136
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:13,939
Should
start kissing now.

137
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,606
But I hardly know you.

138
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,743
As a good-bye kiss?

139
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,710
Ok, bye.
Bye.

140
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:21,345
Both: UNH.

141
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,914
What was that?

142
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:25,450
Cats.

143
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,985
B-b-big cats.

144
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,088
Actually, they're
the hotel singer's twins.

145
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:33,324
When she works late,
I let them stay with me.

146
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,525
You are so...

147
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,294
Yes, I am.

148
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:38,796
Well, I better go.

149
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,099
Uh, not before
you say good-bye.

150
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,572
They're kissing good-bye.

151
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:52,310
Didn't they just say good-bye?

152
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,748
Hey, thanks for letting me stay the night.
Sure, no problem.

153
00:06:57,783 --> 00:07:02,821
So, word on the street is
that Jason's kind of cute.

154
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:03,421
Oh, beyond.

155
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:07,458
And he thinks I'm the most intelligent,
beautiful, down-to-earth rich girl

156
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,693
he's ever met.

157
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,261
Ok, ok, whoa.

158
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:13,598
Back up. Rich?

159
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:15,566
It's complicated?

160
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,568
I was doing London
a favor.

161
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,402
It's not like
I wanted to do it.

162
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:23,341
Oh, yeah, must've been torture
to have to kiss that boy.

Cats told me.

164
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:30,815
So when are you gonna
tell him the truth?

165
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:32,817
Never. He's gone.

166
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:34,152
It was only
for one night,

167
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:34,819
and I'll never
see him again.

168
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:38,422
Maddie, can you take us to
the park on your way home?

169
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,025
Sure. Come on.

170
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,227
Don't bring back
another homeless squirrel.

171
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,896

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,599
Hello?

00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:50,402
Oh, no.

175
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,870
Maddie, these are my parents.
Hi, hi.

176
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:56,107
I, uh, thought you'd be on
your way to Bermuda by now.

177
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:01,612
Well, so did we. But Jason insisted
on another night in Boston.

178
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,981
And now I know why.

179
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:06,484
Yeah, Jason has spoken
of nothing but you

180
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:09,187
all the way from the lobby
up to our room.

181
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:12,023
And our room is on
a very high floor.

182
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:14,158
You checking out?

183
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,061
Um, uh...

184
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,029
No. She's moving
to the top floor,

186
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:24,435
Her old suite was the
wrong shade of beige.

187
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,239
Well, we were just coming
down to invite you to dinner.

188
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,108
I convinced them to take us
to club nouveau.

189
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,842
Really? Wow.

190
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:36,081
I can't go. Yeah, I promised
I'd baby-sit the boys tonight.

191
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:43,454
Oh, yes, Jason told us about your
charity work with indigent children.

192

Cody, hey, Josh called.

193

We're sleeping over
at his house tonight.

Excellent.
Now you can join us.

Uh, uh...

196

We're on the top floor
as well. In fact,

we'll pick you up.
7:00 sharp.

What am I
going to do?

199
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:16,654
Here's a wild thought.
Tell 'em the truth.

200
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:17,488
I don't think so.
I mean,

201
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:21,892
if I tell them now, Jason will look
like a fool, and I will look like--

202
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:24,529
a lying gold digger?

203

Which you're not.

204
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,769
How am I gonna
get out of this?

205
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:32,637
We'll help you
with Jason.

206
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:37,508
Why would I help my future wife
hook up with some other dude?

207
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:41,913
Because he's leaving tomorrow,
and she'll owe you big time.

Ok...Here's what we do--

00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:49,520
first, we get you
an imperial suite.

Do you have any idea
how much they cost?

211
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,759
Aw, she thought
we're gonna pay.

212

That's sweet.
No, we don't pay, baby.

Hey, Esteban,
moseby's yellin' for ya.

For me? He never
yells for me.

223
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:38,436
He yells at me, but only when
I deserve it, which is often.

He's a great man.

a great man waiting.

Yeah. But this dress
must go to London.

pockets before they leave.

You can see the park
from here.

Yes. That's what

cut them down.

after the dinner
that George pays for

that Jason loves

have one night here,

behind a pole.

in maddie's suite.

Is that the expensive one?

Everything at the tipton
is expensive.

Perfect. 'Cause the

gets back.

don't mean to bother you.

I have your autograph?

Well, of course you can,
